Difference between React Native Props and State:

Props are immutable but state is mutable. Props are normally passed from parent component to its child component. But,
state is maintained in each component. Using props, we can change the state of a parent component.


How does useState work?
create a functional component and throw some React hook at it that tracks state, can also update it, and it just works.


Purpose of useEffect other than fetching data.
useEffect can be used to set up a timer that updates the component state after a certain amount of time has passed. It
can also be used to subscribe to events, such as keyboard or mouse events, and perform actions based on those events



How Does React work?
React works by creating a virtual DOM in memory, which is a lightweight representation of the actual DOM. Instead of
manipulating the browser's DOM directly, React manipulates the virtual DOM, where it does all the necessary changes
before making the changes in the browser DOM. React only changes what needs to be changed, which makes it more efficient
than traditional DOM manipulation
